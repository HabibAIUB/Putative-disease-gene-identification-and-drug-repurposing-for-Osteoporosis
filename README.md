# Putative Disease Gene Identification and Drug Repurposing for Osteoporosis

This repository contains the code, notebook, and report for **Group 14â€™s Bioinformatics and Network Medicine project (2025)**.  
We reconstruct the human interactome, identify putative osteoporosis genes using network algorithms, and explore drug repurposing opportunities.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Human interactome construction from **BioGRID**
- Osteoporosis-associated genes curated from **DISEASES database**
- Comparative analysis of algorithms: **DIAMOnD, DiaBLE, Diffusion**
- Gene enrichment with **Enrichr**
- Drug repurposing using **DGIdb** and validation with **ClinicalTrials.gov**
- Final report included in `reports/`
