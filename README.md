# Putative Disease Gene Identification and Drug Repurposing for Osteoporosis

This repository contains code, analysis, and results for a project that applies **network biology** to uncover new candidate genes and drug repurposing opportunities for osteoporosis. By combining interactome reconstruction, disease gene mapping, predictive algorithms, enrichment analysis, and drug–gene interaction data, this work provides a reproducible framework for exploring therapeutic strategies in complex diseases.

## 🔬 Overview

Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease characterized by reduced bone density and increased fracture risk. Current therapies are limited, motivating the search for **novel targets and repurposable drugs**.

This project:
- Reconstructs the **human interactome** from BioGRID.
- Maps curated **osteoporosis-associated genes** onto the interactome.
- Applies multiple algorithms to predict new putative disease genes.
- Validates predictions through **enrichment analysis** (GO, KEGG, Reactome).
- Links prioritized genes to **approved drugs** via DGIdb.
- Cross-checks drug relevance with **clinical trial data**.

## 🛠️ Methods

1. **Interactome Construction**  
   - Protein–protein interactions downloaded from BioGRID.  
   - Filtered for *Homo sapiens* and physical interactions.  
   - Extracted the largest connected component (LCC).  

2. **Gene–Disease Associations (GDA)**  
   - Osteoporosis-related genes curated from DISEASES database.  
   - Mapped onto the interactome to form the disease LCC.  

3. **Candidate Gene Prediction**  
   - Algorithms tested:  
     - **DIAMOnD** (best performing)  
     - **DiaBLE**  
     - **Diffusion-based**  
   - Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation using precision, recall, and F1-score.  

4. **Enrichment Analysis**  
   - Compared known vs. predicted gene sets with **Enrichr**.  
   - Assessed GO terms, KEGG pathways, Reactome pathways.  

5. **Drug Repurposing**  
   - Queried DGIdb for drug–gene interactions.  
   - Validated hits using **ClinicalTrials.gov**.

## 📊 Key Results

- **100 putative disease genes** predicted by DIAMOnD.  
- Enrichment analysis revealed significant overlap with known osteoporosis pathways.  
- Drug repurposing identified several candidate drugs, including:  
  - **Lamivudine** and **Tenofovir** (validated in clinical trials).  
  - CDK2-linked drugs (e.g., Paclitaxel, Lovastatin, Dexamethasone).  
- Comparison with **ProConSuL** algorithm confirmed robustness of prioritized genes.
